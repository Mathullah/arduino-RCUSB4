RC â€“ USB Adapter
================

# Intro

This project is based on DIY RC USB adapter for VRC PRO from Nicholas Regitz a.k.a. Kekse23 and was forked from [gbraad/arduino-RCUSB4](https://github.com/gbraad/arduino-RCUSB4). As the original name suggests, the purpose of the interface is to connect a RC radio control system (with four channels) to a host computer. To achieve this, the interface enumerates a USB HID joystick device. This works not only on Windows system with VRC PRO but actualy on all operating system and simulators / games which supports an USB joystick.
